# Project1 - Football Hooligans   

A javascript game where you can show your die hard support for your favorite trademark neutral sportsball team by battling misguided hooligan supporters for other teams.  Battle in iconic locations from the hometown of you or your opponent's favorite team with realtime weather, and track your stats.  Utilize unique powerup-options to unlock special abilities, but watch out, if you get too rowdy you might wind up in the back of a police van.
